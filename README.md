Methodology:
Methodology: Anomaly Detection in Computer Networks using Autoencoders
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather network traffic data, which includes packet headers, flow data, or higher-level features.
Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a suitable format for model training.
Autoencoder Architecture Design:
Design the architecture of the autoencoder:
Encoder: Comprises multiple hidden layers to map input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
Latent Space: A compressed representation of the data capturing essential features.
Decoder: Reconstructs the original data from the latent space representation.
Model Training:
Split the preprocessed dataset into training, validation, and potentially testing subsets.
Train the autoencoder using the training data:
Minimize the reconstruction loss, typically using a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.
Implement techniques such as dropout, regularization, and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation and Tuning:
Validate the trained autoencoder using the validation dataset:
Monitor reconstruction loss and assess its performance in capturing normal patterns.
Fine-tune the model hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, latent space dimensions, and learning rate, using techniques like grid search or random search.
Threshold Determination:
Use statistical analysis or domain expertise to determine an appropriate threshold for the reconstruction loss.
The threshold helps distinguish normal behavior from anomalies. Instances with higher reconstruction loss above this threshold are considered anomalies.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing Steps
Preprocessing the captured network traffic data is a crucial step to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training the autoencoder model. The following preprocessing steps are applied to the raw network traffic data collected using tools like Wireshark:
Data Extraction:
Extract relevant information from the captured packets, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types, packet sizes, timestamps, and any other pertinent metadata.
Feature Selection:
Choose the most informative features that contribute to distinguishing normal network behavior from anomalies.
Exclude irrelevant or redundant features that might introduce noise into the model.
Normalization:
Normalize numeric features to a common scale (e.g., between 0 and 1) to prevent features with larger values from dominating the learning process.

Autoencoder Architecture
An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder attempts to reconstruct the original data from this compressed representation. In anomaly detection, the autoencoder learns to capture the normal patterns of the data, and deviations from these patterns are indicative of anomalies.

Encoder Architecture:
Input Layer: Accepts the preprocessed network traffic data with the chosen features.
Hidden Layers: Consist of multiple fully connected (dense) layers that gradually reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Use activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity.
The number of nodes in each hidden layer can decrease progressively to form a bottleneck, which represents the latent space.
Latent Space:
Bottleneck Layer: This layer represents the compressed latent space representation of the input data.
The number of nodes in this layer defines the dimensionality of the latent space.
Decoder Architecture:
Hidden Layers: Symmetrically mirror the encoder's hidden layers but in reverse order.
These layers aim to reconstruct the original data from the latent space representation.
Use activation functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity.
Output Layer: Produces the reconstructed data that ideally matches the input data.

Hyperparameters:

Number of Hidden Layers: Configurable based on the complexity of the network traffic data.
Number of Nodes per Layer: Decreases from the input layer to the latent space and increases in the decoder.
Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is commonly used for hidden layers and output layer.
Bottleneck Dimension: Determined based on the desired level of data compression.
Model Training:
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a typical choice for reconstruction tasks.
Optimization Algorithm: Adam optimizer is commonly used for gradient descent.
Keep in mind that the specific architecture details may vary based on your project's requirements, dataset characteristics, and experimentation. It's recommended to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the one that works best for your anomaly detection task.

Statistical Analysis:
Begin by analyzing the reconstruction loss values generated during the validation phase of model training.
Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, median, and percentiles of the reconstruction loss values.
Visualization:
Create visualizations of the reconstruction loss distribution, such as histograms or density plots.
Examine the distribution to identify the typical range of reconstruction loss values associated with normal network behavior.
