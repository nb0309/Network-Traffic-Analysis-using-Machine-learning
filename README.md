# Anomaly Detection In Computer Network
In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, safeguarding computer networks from malicious activities and unusual behavior has become paramount. Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating potential threats in real-time. This description explores the concept of anomaly detection in computer networks, with a focus on how it can be optimized using Intel's extension for TensorFlow.

Anomaly detection is a sophisticated technique used to identify patterns and behaviors that deviate significantly from normal network activity. In computer networks, normal behavior is typically established by observing historical data, which is then used as a benchmark for detecting anomalies. Anomalies can be indicative of security breaches, network failures, or other irregularities that warrant immediate attention.



## Data
Wireshark captures various data when monitoring network traffic:
```
Packet Information: Individual network packets with details like source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, packet length, and payload content.
Protocol Analysis: Identification and decoding of network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP) for deeper inspection.
Decoding: Human-readable representation of packet data structures (e.g., DNS queries, HTTP requests).
Statistics: Captured packet statistics, including duration, data rates, and potential issues like packet loss.
Filtering: Tools to focus on specific traffic types or search for keywords.
Visualization: Packet flow visualization for understanding network communication patterns.
Expert Info: Flags warnings or errors related to packet issues.
Hierarchy: Displays the protocol breakdown in the capture.
Export: Allows saving captures for further analysis or reporting in different formats.

## Model:
In the pursuit of robust anomaly detection in computer network data, a combination of two powerful techniques has been employed: Isolation Forest and Autoencoders. This dual approach harnesses the strengths of both methodologies to enhance the precision and effectiveness of anomaly detection in complex network environments.

Autoencoders Architecture:

Input Layer:
```
Neurons: Number of input features (determined by input_dim).

Activation: None (raw input).
```
Encoding Layers:
```
Layer 1: Dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.

Dropout: 20% dropout for regularization.
Layer 2: Dense layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation.

Encoding Bottleneck: Dense layer with encoding_dim (10) neurons and ReLU activation.
```
Decoding Layers:
```
Layer 1: Dense layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation.

Dropout: 20% dropout for regularization.

Layer 2: Dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.

Output Layer: Dense layer with the same number of neurons as input features (specified by input_dim) and sigmoid activation.
```
Model Compilation:
```
Optimizer: Adam optimizer.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for reconstruction loss.
Training:

Input and Target: Scaled input data (X_scaled) used as both input and target.
Epochs: 20.
Batch Size: 32.
```
Anomaly Detection:
```
After training, the model calculates MSE between original data and its reconstruction.
Anomaly threshold is set at the 99.9th percentile of MSE values.
```
Identifying Anomalies:
```
Data points with MSE above the threshold are considered
```

Ensemble Method:

Combinig both randomforestclassifier and isolation forest.

Isolation Forest (IsolationForest):
```
Isolation Forest is used for initial anomaly score estimation.
contamination is set to 0.0045, and random_state is 42.
Anomaly scores are predicted for data points, where -1 indicates anomalies and 1 indicates normal data.
```
Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier):
```
Random Forest Classifier refines the anomaly detection process.
n_estimators is 100, and random_state is 42.
It is trained on features and anomaly labels derived from the Isolation Forest.
Anomaly predictions are made, and anomalies are identified where the prediction is 0 (anomaly).
```
